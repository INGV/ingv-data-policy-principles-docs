Metadata
========

The term “metadata” refers to a structured set of information describing
a data. For example, the information may refer to the sensor that
provided the data (e.g. position, type, calibration of the sensor), the
data acquisition technique (e.g. sampling frequency), to the modes of
analysis of the data (e.g. analysis lab, type of model used), or to the
context in which the data was generated (e.g. project, ordinary
activity).
