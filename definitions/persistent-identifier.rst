Persistent Identifier
=====================

The Persistent Identifier is an alphanumeric code whose structure is
defined within objects management systems (data, books, persons,
physical samples, etc.), some of which follow open and internationally
shared standards (Open Standard). The adjective “persistent” refers to
the characteristic of guaranteeing that the association between the
associated object’s identification code and its position on the Web is
maintained over the long term. This means not only that the identifier
management, but also access to the associated object, are maintained
operational over time. A data may be associated with one or more types
of Persistent Identifiers.
