Services
========

The term “service” is to be understood as any of the following services
applicable to a database, such as for example: Data Search, Data
Visualization, Transfer, Transformation, Editing, and/or Updating. The
individual service available for a database may be:

-  Open: the service is freely available and accessible to all, without
   restrictions;

-  Restricted: the service is available, but only under the conditions
   established or agreed upon by/with the holder of the right to exploit
   the intellectual property; a particular case is that of data for
   which a certain type of service (typically the transfer) may be
   accessed, for a predefined period of time (the “embargo period”).
