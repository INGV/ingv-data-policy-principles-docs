Access
======

The term “access” refers to a user’s authorization or right to access
the data via an infrastructure associated with a database. These
accesses may be broken down, in relation to the modes of user
identification and registration, as follows:

-  Anonymous/Guest: access to the service(s) takes place with no
   identification or accreditation procedure;

-  Registered/Standard: access to the service(s) requires an
   identification by means of accreditation procedures which may be
   automated;

-  Authorized: access to the service(s) requires specific authorization
   by the database manager.

For the purposes of IT security, the access procedures have three
functions: 1) user Identification, 2) Authentication of credentials, and
3) Authorization to use some services.
