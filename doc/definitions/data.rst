Data
====

The term “data” identifies individual items or records of any nature
(physical or digital), at any level of processing, and however
organized, as well as research products even if unpublished. The term is
thus used in this setting in its more general connotation, and refers to
publications, the raw data acquired by a sensor, the physical sample of
any nature, or a product obtained from any analysis on the data at any
level of processing, whether automatic or manual. To bring the
definitions in line with the regulations in force, it is useful to bear
in mind that the data may be classified as follows:

-  Static data: the data, once generated and/or published, are no longer
   updated;

-  Dynamic data: the data may be modified or extended after being
   published. These data may be further broken down based on the type of
   variation:

-  data subject to revision, modifiable for the purpose of improving
   their quality/reliability;

-  continuously produced data, data produced by sensors that generate a
   time series;

-  Spatial data, any geographically localized information [1]_;

-  Personal data, any information pertaining to a natural person, legal
   person, body or association, identified or identifiable, even
   indirectly, through reference to any other information, including a
   personal identification number;

-  Other types of data, defined as *“all the databases managed for the
   pursuit of institutional purposes, including those connected with the
   functioning of the administration”*; [2]_

-  Open data, which is to say “usable, reusable, or redistributable
   freely by anyone, also for commercial purposes, subject at most to
   the request for attribution and sharing in the same manner” [3]_.

   According to the European INSPIRE Directive, these are “any data with
   a direct or indirect reference to a specific location or geographical
   area” (EC Directive 2007/2/EC)

   This is information pertaining, for example, to personnel, financial
   statements, protocol, document management, etc.)” (Art. 24-quater,

   The Digital Administration Code (Codice dell'Amministrazione Digitale
   – CAD, Legislative Decree no. 82 of 07 March 2005.). Art. 68,
   paragraph 3, defines as open-type digital data those data that:

   Are available in accordance with the terms of a license that permits
   the use thereof by anyone, also for commercial purposes, in
   disaggregated format;

   Are accessible via information and communication technologies,
   including public and private telematic networks, in open formats, are
   suited to automatic use by computer programs, and are provided with
   the related metadata;

   Are made available free of charge via information and communication
   technologies, including public and private telematic networks, or are
   made available at the marginal costs incurred for reproduction and
   dissemination thereof.
