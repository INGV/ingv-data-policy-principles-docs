Open Access
===========

INGV adopts the principle of Open Access to research data produced in
the context of research activities financed with public funds, in order
to:

-  permit free, open, full, and prompt access to its data;

-  improve the quality of the data, and the pertinence, acceptability,
   and sustainability of the results;

-  reduce the possibility of duplication of research activities;

-  accelerate scientific progress;

-  give stakeholders a way to interact in the research cycle, by
   integrating societyâ€™s expectations, needs, interests, and values.
