Legal Management of Data
========================

INGV is committed to applying and adopting the complex and stratified
national and EU regulations in force regarding the availability of the
data of public administrations, data access services, the regulation of
intellectual property, the modes of the exploitability of the data, and
the criteria for managing open data [1]_.

.. [1]
   It appears difficult to include the multitude of legislative
   interventions in the matter. Therefore, for the purpose of
   systematizing and making more immediately perceptible the state of
   the regulations in force, a summary table was prepared, including a
   regulatory framework existing on the international, European, and
   national level on the date of the drawing-up hereof (Attachment 1).
