Assignment of Persistent Identifiers
====================================

INGV is committed to adopting persistent identifiers for the purposes of
achieving:

-  Univocal identification of the data, regardless of its position;

-  The traceability of the data, both inside and outside INGV;

-  Durability and reliability over time, with the related burden of
   sustainability;

-  Certifying the dataâ€™s authorship and consequently their degree of
   authoritativeness;

-  A mapping of the relationships both among own data and with data
   generated externally;

-  Facilitating the protection of investments.

In order to effect an informed management of the attribution of the
persistent identifiers, INGV will have a Regulation for this purpose,
containing operative instructions on the applicant, assignment of
licences, categorization, and all else needed for effective attribution.
