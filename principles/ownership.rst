Ownership
=========

To balance the rights and the complex of opposing interests, INGV
accommodates and adopts the Open Access paradigm aimed at fostering
public access to information and data sharing, where necessary
compromising individual needs in favour of the public interest.

For Level 0 and 1 data, considering the restricted intellectual property
thereto, INGV assumes full ownership and therefore the pro tempore Legal
Representative manages its complex of rights such as the attribution of
Licences, the assignment of Persistent Identifiers, and the signing of
agreements for the management and use thereof.

For Level 2 and 3 data, INGV is committed to adopting a Regulation for
attributing authorship of a specific data to an INGV individual or
working group employee.

The ownership of the publications is established based on the
regulations in force and on those of the journals in which the work is
published. INGV recognizes, as publishing models, the proprietary one
adopted by most scientific publications, in which the author grants the
publisher the right to publish the original work, also transferring the
right to its reuse, and the Open Access model (“Green road,” “Gold
road”) according to which the author maintains the rights to his or her
work for the recognition of ownership, for a greater dissemination of
the results and to allow its reuse.
