Categorization
==============

In order to proceed with the definition of the principles of appropriate
data management, INGV makes the following categorization:

Publications: The term “Publications” is to be understood as all the
research products published in magazines, books, or series of books,
following the respective editorial lines.

Research Data: INGV categorizes the research data in four Levels
distinguished based on their degree of processing:

-  Level 0: raw data, or basic data, acquired automatically or manually,
   with no level of processing, excluding an automatic-type validation
   (examples: waveforms, GPS data, uncalibrated images, rock samples,
   etc.);

-  Level 1: data products obtained from automatic or semiautomatic
   procedures (examples: localization, magnitude, focal mechanisms of
   earthquakes, shakemaps, historic series of the amplitude of volcanic
   tremor, and of movement of GPS stations, etc.);

-  Level 2: data products obtained from the research activity and at any
   rate based on non-automatic procedures (examples: crust models,
   strain maps, source models of earthquakes and of deformations,
   results of geophysical campaigns, etc.);

-  Level 3: integrated data products obtained from complex analyses that
   integrate several Level 2 products, or from analyses that integrate
   Level 1 or 2 products of different types and/or originating from
   different communities (examples: hazard maps, catalogues of active
   faults, volcanic activity reports, etc.).

For the needs of clarity and the valorisation of professional figures,
INGV is committed to instituting a Research Data Registry classifying
the data within the Levels defined above, associating each with the
attributes necessary for managing ownership, Licenses, Persistent
Identifiers, access rules, and the rules for accessing the necessary
links to the source of the data.
